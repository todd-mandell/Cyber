🧭 Cybersecurity Audit Procedure for Your Company
Step 1: Define Audit Scope and Objectives
    • Identify systems to be audited (software, networks, etc)
    • Clarify goals: compliance with updated cybersecurity standards, risk reduction, and readiness for funding or certification.
Step 2: Review Existing Cybersecurity Standards
    • Gather current cybersecurity policies, procedures, and technical standards.
    • Compare them against national frameworks (e.g., NIST, CJIS, ISO 27001).
    • Document gaps, outdated practices, and areas needing revision.
Step 3: Conduct Site Assessments
    • Visit each operational site (e.g., offices, datacenters).
    • Interview key personnel (IT, administrative, security).
    • Review:
        ◦ Physical security
        ◦ Network architecture
        ◦ System configurations
        ◦ Access controls
        ◦ Incident response plans
        ◦ Training programs
Step 4: Perform Technical Gap Analysis
    • Evaluate each system component:
        ◦ Interfaces: Firewalls, demarcation points, segmentation
    • Use tools like vulnerability scanners and configuration checkers.
    • Rate compliance against updated standards.
Step 5: Identify and Prioritize Risks
    • Classify vulnerabilities by severity (critical, high, medium, low).
    • Prioritize based on impact to public safety, data sensitivity, and likelihood of exploitation.
    • Include cost estimates for remediation.
Step 6: Research and Apply Best Practices
    • Identify industry best practices for each system type.
    • Develop tailored recommendations for your company.
    • Include:
        ◦ Updated policies
        ◦ Technical controls
        ◦ Staff training modules
        ◦ Incident response enhancements
Step 7: Document Findings and Recommendations
    • Create detailed audit reports for each site/system:
        ◦ Compliance rating
        ◦ Gaps and vulnerabilities
        ◦ Recommended actions
        ◦ Cost and timeline estimates
    • Summarize findings in a company-wide report for leadership and stakeholders.
Step 8: Ensure Confidentiality and Compliance
    • Secure all audit data and reports.
    • Ensure CJIS compliance and local confidentiality agreements.
    • Limit access to sensitive findings to authorized personnel only.
Step 9: Develop Action Plans
    • Create draft remediation plans for each site/system.
    • Align plans with funding cycles or grant opportunities.
    • Include timelines, responsible personnel, and measurable outcomes.
Step 10: Monitor Progress and Report
    • Schedule regular interval briefings to track progress.
    • Update leadership on milestones, challenges, and successes.
    • Adjust plans as needed based on evolving threats or organizational changes.
