🛡️ Penetration Testing Workflow with Task Delegation
1. Kick-Off & Planning
    • Conduct a kickoff meeting with the client to define:
        ◦ Scope of testing
        ◦ Rules of engagement
        ◦ Out-of-bounds systems and timeframes
    • Ensure a formal approval document is prepared and signed.
    • Confirm existence of a Master Service Agreement (MSA) with the client before initiating any testing.
2. Reconnaissance & Target Identification
    • Perform footprinting and intelligence gathering to build a target list.
    • Delegate basic OSINT tasks to junior staff; results can be submitted in any format.
    • Pen testers analyze OSINT results to identify assets, lateral movement paths, and potential vulnerabilities.
3. Asset Classification
    • Create a spreadsheet of all discovered items/IPs.
    • Classify assets as:
        ◦ External (Internet-facing)
            ▪ First-party owned
            ▪ Third-party owned (passive testing only)
        ◦ Internal
            ▪ Accessible from the internet
            ▪ Not intended to be internet-accessible
4. Scope Document Preparation
    • Present scope document to client for approval, including:
        ◦ Authorized testers
        ◦ Target networks, hosts, applications
        ◦ Rules of engagement
        ◦ Testing timeframe
        ◦ Data handling and retention policies
        ◦ Client-side chain of command
5. Statement of Work (SOW)
    • Draft a SOW specific to the engagement:
        ◦ Details of the pen test
        ◦ Scope expansion provisions
        ◦ Contact information for:
            ▪ Emergency site contact with authority
            ▪ Technical contact with infrastructure decision-making power
6. Human & Physical Vulnerability Evaluation
    • Typically outsourced (e.g., phishing campaigns via third-party vendors).
    • If physical breach is required, obtain written authorization from the client.
7. Engagement Execution
    • Begin with external/remote systems.
    • For on-site testing:
        ◦ Limited engagement: Wi-Fi, RF broadcasts, public access areas only
        ◦ Full engagement: May include entering restricted areas and planting persistent access devices (with permission)
    • Avoid tampering with systems or causing outages.
8. Result Validation
    • Document all findings and methods used.
    • Delegate validation tasks to junior team members:
        ◦ If findings can't be replicated, mark as invalid.
        ◦ Determine if invalidation is due to inaccurate testing or remediation.
        ◦ Include reasoning in the final report.
9. Reporting & Remediation
    • Summarize validated findings.
    • Provide remediation recommendations aligned with the OSI model (e.g., physical access, Layer 2 vulnerabilities).
    • Include optional cost-benefit analysis.
    • Present report to client and confirm acceptance.
10. Post-Engagement Cleanup
    • Remove any accounts or access created during testing.
    • If audit and pen test are separate:
        ◦ Audit assumes full access
        ◦ Pen test assumes no prior access
    • Destroy sensitive data and reports after the agreed retention period.
